    "A thick-cut ribeye cooked properly to maximize flavor, fat rendering, and tenderness—pure carnivore fuel.",
  servings: 1,
  prep_time: "10 min",
  cook_time: "10 min",
  difficulty: "Medium",
  tags: ["Dinner", "Healthy", "Gluten-Free", "Dairy-Free"],

  ingredients: [
    { name: "Ribeye steak", quantity: "1", unit: "lb" },
    { name: "Salt", quantity: "to taste", unit: "" },
  ],

  steps: [
    "Remove the ribeye from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking. This allows the meat to come to room temperature for even cooking.",
    "Pat the steak completely dry on all sides using paper towels. Removing surface moisture is critical for proper searing.",
    "Season the steak generously with salt on both sides. Do not add pepper, as it can burn at high heat.",
    "Place a heavy cast-iron skillet over high heat and allow it to preheat for 2–3 minutes until extremely hot.",
    "Place the steak into the dry skillet. Do not move it. Let it sear undisturbed for 3–4 minutes to form a deep brown crust.",
    "Flip the steak using tongs and sear the second side for another 3–4 minutes.",
    "Using tongs, stand the steak on its fat edge and render the fat for 30–60 seconds until golden.",
    "Remove the steak from the pan once internal temperature reaches 130–135°F for medium-rare.",
    "Let the steak rest on a plate for 5 minutes. Resting allows juices to redistribute and prevents dryness.",
    "Slice against the grain and serve immediately.",
